Install homebrew via Jamf without giving users admin rights

This script installs homebrew for the logged in user without requiring them to be an Administrator.

It is designed to be used in an MDM such as Jamf Pro.

Thanks to Richard Purves for the first version.

Thanks to all my users for feedback and improvements.
